njoytest - NABU Joystick Test

I used snake.c (by David Latham aka productiondave) as a starting point:  https://github.com/linuxplayground/nabu-games

Does not work with ISHKUR CP/M

Does not work with Marduk

Works with MAME NABUPC (nabupc-wip branch)

njoytest.nabu - works with nabud (haven't tested with any other, but should work)

njoytest.com - works with Cloud CP/M (works with Leo's NABU CP/M 3.0, but crashes on exit)
